# Gyroscopic Module

![turns out...](item:tisvs:gyroscopic_module)

The Gyroscopic Module outputs 4 separate representations of a Ship's rotation at any given time out of 7 total representations via half-point precision floats.


If this module is not installed in a casing on a Ship, then all values will return NaN in half-point precision floats.

- qX
Represents and outputs the X value of the Ship's Quaternion representation
- qY
Represents and outputs the Y value of the Ship's Quaternion representation
- qZ
Represents and outputs the Z value of the Ship's Quaternion representation
- qW
Represents and outputs the W value of the Ship's Quaternion representation
- Roll
Represents and outputs the roll of a Ship
- Pitch
Represents and outputs the pitch of a Ship
- Yaw
Represents and outputs the yaw of a Ship


These modes can be switched individually by right-clicking the displayed modes when installed.
